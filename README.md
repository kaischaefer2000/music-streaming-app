## Spotify remote webplayer
This application is deeply connected to the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ "Spotify Web API"). Its styling is similar to the [original spotify web-player](https://open.spotify.com/ "original spotify web-player"). The application can be seen as some kind of remote control for an active spotify service. You can play songs from different playlists, controle the volume, skip songs or look at your favourite artists.

## Rendering
This application was programmed as part of my bachelor thesis in which i compare the performance of rendering strategies. I coded it with Client Side Rendering, Server Side Rendering and a combination of both. 
This version uses Client Side Rendering and Server Side Rendering in a combination, where the initial data gets fetched by the server and following updates on the components get handled by the useEffect Hook.
